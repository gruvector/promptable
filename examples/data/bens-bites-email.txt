Microsoft releases Teams Premium using ChatGPT technology ( https://twitter=
.com/satyanadella/status/1620923372858380289 )
ChatGPT has officially just swooped into the mainstream with Microsoft=E2=
=80=99s release of Teams Premium, with the AI technology being fully embedd=
ed! Now I=E2=80=99ve just gotta convince my boss to fork out $7=E2=80=A6 Th=
e tech comes with automatically generated meeting notes, recommended tasks,=
 and personalised highlights, and looks pretty damn slick ( https://www.mic=
rosoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/02/01/microsoft-teams-premium-cut-=
costs-and-add-ai-powered-productivity/ ) to boot.=C2=A0

ChatGPT releases $20/month subscription plan ( https://techcrunch.com/2023/=
02/01/openai-launches-chatgpt-plus-starting-at-20-per-month/ )
Getting =E2=80=9Cservers busy=E2=80=9D messages on ChatGPT when you most wa=
nt to use it? Well, wave that frustration goodbye for $20=E2=80=94gotta mak=
e that $10bn back for investors. (But yeah, you=E2=80=99re right, the $42 p=
ro fee that was doing the rounds indeed looks like some kind of weird error=
.)
Besides, this seems like a pretty reasonable fee for something that can hel=
p you with basically anything and only lies sometimes. Sam Altman has even =
hinted at upcoming, potentially cheaper, pro plans. It=E2=80=99s a shame th=
at I=E2=80=99m based in England, and it=E2=80=99s only available in the US=

AI chatbots can actually make us more skilled ( https://oneusefulthing.subs=
tack.com/p/the-machines-of-mastery )
With chatter circulating that over-use of chatbots can dumb you down, this =
article actually makes a pretty compelling case for why using AI can make y=
ou smarter. (And no, sitting there like a potato all day letting ChatGPT do=
 your dirty work is not how it works.)
They show a pretty awesome example of getting a chatbot to create scenarios=
 to respond to, giving feedback on their responses, and then discussing how=
 they can do better. Real, mistakes-driven practice=E2=80=94which is how an=
yone can get better at anything.=C2=A0

Git commands in plain English ( https://git.roo.app/ )
For some of you seasoned developers, it may come as a surprise that a lot o=
f people really struggle with using git from the command line. Personally, =
I remember a time when it drove me absolutely crazy, and would have loved n=
othing more than=C2=A0this tool ( https://git.roo.app/ ). Type what you wan=
t to do into the command line in plain old English, and out comes the git c=
ommand. Wicked!

on & AI. What if you hired a cast of professional voice actors,=C2=A0a team=
