/**
Question Answering

Method for augmenting GPT-3 with a large body of additional contextual information by using document embeddings and retrieval.

This method answers queries in two steps:

1. retrieves the information relevant to the query,
2. writes an answer tailored to the question based on the retrieved information.

The first step uses the Embeddings API, the second step uses the Completions API.

The steps are:

1. Preprocess the contextual information by splitting it into chunks and create an embedding vector for each chunk.
2. On receiving a query, embed the query in the same vector space as the context chunks and find the context embeddings which are most similar to the query.
3. Prepend the most relevant context embeddings to the query prompt.
    4. Submit the question along with the most relevant context to GPT, and receive an answer which makes use of the provided contextual information.
