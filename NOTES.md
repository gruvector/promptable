- Highlight the Completion Streaming
- Implementing the different Model Provider APIs is hugely valuable.

# Issues

Tracing:
for future ref:
1- changes the this so you have to pass an anonymous fn, can't do this.prompt.format
2- the inputs always show up as [Array] in the trace

# Features to add

- Validation of Generated Outputs.
- Retry logic
- Caching / Fuzzy input matching
- Transformation of inputs / outputs

UI Tools

- Compare prompt / chain across different providers?
