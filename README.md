# Promptable 

Build fullstack AI apps in Typescript/Javascript. 

## What is this?

Promptable consists of a collection of utilities and interfaces that help you build applications with LLMs. It is designed to be flexible and extensible so that you can use it with any LLM or Embeddings provider.

The goal of this library is to provide a set of general tools for Typescript and Javascript developers to help them build fullstack AI first applications quickly and easily.

> ! Right now the library is in early development and is very much experimental. Don't use this in production yet! The API is subject to change as we get feedback.

## Install and Run

Then to install run (at the root)

```
pnpm i

```

To install package in a single workspace

```

pnpm i <package> --filter <workspace>

```

First copy the `apps/web/.env.example` file to `apps/web/.env`.

Then, To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```

cd my-turborepo
pnpm run dev

```

This will start watching the files for changes.
